https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38961649/gcc-how-to-create-a-mapfile-of-the-object-file

If you are linking the program and want to generate map output add:

 -Xlinker -Map=output.map 

to the gcc command in order to make it create the map file output.map

If you want to see the symbols and relocation of an object file, you can use the objdump tool:

objdump -x an_object_file.o
