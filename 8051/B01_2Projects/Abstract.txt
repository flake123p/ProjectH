The Keil PK51 Professional Developers Kit Version 8 provides several tool extensions
that help you to develop multi-application projects. Such projects are required when 
you need to load specific application extensions at execution time of a boot application.

For demonstration of the toolchain features the following project shows you how to
combine a Boot_Loader and Application part within the same uVision project. Therefore
this project contains two targets:

 - Boot_Loader is the bootstrap or root application that calls functions in Application. 
   The Boot_Loader part is intended to perform CPU initialization and contains functions 
   and global variables that are accessed from Application.

 - Application is developed independent of Boot_Loader and is intended to extent the 
   Boot_Loader functions. Therefore Application accesses variables and functions of
   Boot_Loader.
